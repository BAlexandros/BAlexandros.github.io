This page is a summary of my education. This includes formal education, like courses
taken in university, and informal like extracurricular courses taken for personal
growth

<h2> Formal Education</h2>

<p>
  My formal education is in the field of Physics, with courses and
  projects related to programming.
</p>

<h3> BSc in Physics </h3>

<p>
  I started my undergraduate studies in 2014, at the Aristotle 
  University of Thessaloniki, and received my BSc in Physics in 2019 
  with a GPA of 8.06/10.
</p>
<p>
  Notable courses and academic projects that defined my undergraduate studies 
  are the following:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Computer Programming and Computational Physics</b><br>
        <p>
          An introductory course to programming in the context of physics.
          This course, taught in C, explored basic IO operations, built-in
          data structures such as arrays and structs, and manual memory management.
          Most importantly, it served as my first contact with programming
          and sparked my drive to continue learning on my own.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Computational Physics and Applications</b><br>
        <p>
          A higher level course which required the development of programs to 
          simulate Solid State Physics and Atmospheric Physics phenomena. The
          language required for the accepted solutions was MATLAB, which despite
          having limited presence in non-academic environments proved a very
          effective tool for scientific projects.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Theoretical Statistical Solid State Physics</b>
        <p>
          Other than its intimidating name, this course was characterized by 
          extensive simulations of Random Number Generators and Random Walks.
          Using Mathematica, RNG formulas were implemented and studied in
          the context of Random Walks and Solid State Physics phenomena (such as
          phase changes).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Bioelectromagnetics</b>
        <p>
          A very interesting course that explored the effects of
          non-ionizing radiation (radio, microwave, etc) on the human body
          and potential medical applications. This course greatly enhances
          the understanding of terminology, phenomena, and the principles which
          dictate how modern devices affect (or don't) the human body. Despite
          the fact that it required no coding, the phenomena studied heavily 
          depend on simulations and one of them became the basis of my thesis.
        </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  The final and most extensive project during my years in the department was my
  undergraduate thesis, titled 
  <b>"Magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia treatment planning optimized for tissue sparing"</b>
  and supervised by professor Theodoros Samaras. The research interests of professor Samaras
  allowed for the undertaking of a thesis which combined my interests in programming and 
  bioelectromagnetics. Developing an extensive program in MATLAB, it was possible to simulate
  and study a large number of cancer treatments to determine the optimal approach. 
  This project later evolved into a paper, which is described
  in the website's <a href="/publications#nanomaterials">publications</a> page.
</p>

<h3> MSc in Computational Physics </h3>

<p>
  I started my MSc in Computational Physics in 2020. My background in physics
  and my interest in programming led me to choose an MSc program that combines
  both. These courses are currently attended online, with a schedule that facilitates
  full time employment. My current GPA is 9.83/10.0. 
</p>

  Some notable courses are the following:
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Data Analysis And Processing with MATLAB</b>
      <p>
        This course focused on the statistical analysis of data. MATLAB
        was used to study distributions, perform testing of hypotheses,
        and study trends.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Programming Languages</b>
      <p>
        Application of various sorting algorithms in C/C++, and
        familiarization with the Visual Studio Code IDE.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Computational Electromagnetics</b>
      <p>
        Analysis and implementation of the algorithms used to study
        phenomena related to electromagnetic waves. As the main course
        project, a MATLAB program
        was created to implement Yee's algorithm and simulate a microwave
        cavity. Additionally, a statistical analysis was performed to 
        study the microwave oven's ability to heat its contents uniformly.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2> Other courses </h2>

These are courses taken independently from the formal education described above. 
What is listed may not offer certificates upon completion, but follows a hands-on 
approach that is very beneficial to personal growth. They are rotated in 
such a way that progress is made weekly on all of them.

<h3>CS61B: Data Structures using Java</h3>

The ability to handle and understand data structures can greatly improve 
the way problems are approached and solved. This course
provides a hands-on approach and requires the users to reimplement data 
structures from scratch, while simultaneously getting familiar with Java and 
Test Driven Development. 

<h3>Full Stack Open</h3>

A complete curriculum for becoming a full stack Javascript developer. This course
teaches the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React.js, Node.js).

<h3>Android Basics using Kotlin</h3>

Mobile applications are an indispensible part of our daily lives. From the 
hobbyist looking to make an app to facilitate their daily routine, to a developer
of a global corporation looking to reach out to its clients, the ability to 
materialize these ideas can be very benificial. I therefore decided to begin
this course in order to learn the basics of developing apps and have the ability
to bring some of my ideas to life. Kotlin was chosen over Java because it is the
modern standard for Android development, and my Java skills are being worked on
with the CS61B course.
