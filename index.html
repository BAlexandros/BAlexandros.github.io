<h2> Some things about me: </h2>

<p>
I was born in 1996 in Thessaloniki, the second-largest city in Greece.
I finished highschool at the 17th Lyceum of Thessaloniki, and enrolled 
in the Physics Department of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 2014. 
In 2019 I completed my undergraduate studies and in early 2020 I had my first
research published. I then enrolled in the Computational Physics MSc program of
Aristotle's University of Thessaloniki, which I am currently attending remotely
on the weekends.

I am a Canadian by descent, and I now live in Kitchener, Ontario.
