Steganographer is a command line program which hides one png
image into another.

<h4> Description </h4>

<p>
Steganography is the practice of concealing information in plain
sight, within non-secret data. Its advantage to cryptography
is that encrypted information is very obvious to the prying eye
because of its unintelligible nature, whereas data hidden using
steganography methods are less likely to arouse suspicion.
</p>

<p>
This program allows the hiding of one image into another, as long
as their file format is png.
</p>

<h4> Implementation </h4>

<p>
The program is written in C, and works as a command line tool.
It uses <a href='http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html'>libpng</a>
to read and write the png files.

Once the files are successfully loaded, the least significant bits of 
the cover image are replaced by the most significant bits of the hidden
image. The default number of bits is 4, which can be changed using the
appropriate flag when calling the program.
</p>
<p>
The process can be reversed, decrypting an image, using the appropriate
flag. Of course, this results in loss of information, since a number
of least significant bits was lost during the process of hiding.
</p>
<p>
The tool was developed and works on Linux, and can be easily built 
with the help of the <i>make</i> utility.

hidden information (left), and the extracted hidden information (right)
